# HeartWise: HeartDiseasePrediction-2.0

HeartWise is an improved version of my earlier machine learning project that predicts heart disease and evaluates heart risk.
It now features an intuitive GUI and incorporates classification and regression models for better analysis.

## Features
- **Classification**: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease using logistic regression.
- **Regression**: Estimates heart risk scores with polynomial regression enhanced by Ridge regularization.
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly interface for data input and predictions.

## How It Works
1. **Classification**: Enter patient details to classify heart disease risk.
2. **Regression**: Provide health indicators to estimate heart risk percentage.
3. **Upload Data**: Use sample data files for predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `tkinter`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the `main.py` file.

## Project Files
- `main.py`: Core application with GUI and models.
- Sample data: Example CSV files for testing.
